# About

Consultant Data Scientist based in Halifax, Canada.

Interested in neuro-symbolic AI for energy and otological research.

## What I Do

I build tools and systems that work. Most of my time goes into data infrastructure, applied ML, and occasionally writing about it.

## This Site

A place for projects and technical writing. More coming as I have things worth sharing.
